# Nile Examples

These examples demonstrate how to use Nile for various use cases.
Each example is automated and can be run independently, so you can run just the ones that you are interested in.
We recommend running them in the following order to build up your SaaS as you go:

0. [Quickstart](quickstart): setup a minimal Nile control plane with a single tenant.
1. [Multi-tenancy](multi-tenancy): setup the Nile control plane with multiple tenants and users in each organization.
2. [Data Plane with Pulumi](data-plane/pulumi/): synchronize your data plane and control plane in real time with Nile events. Even if you're using another tool like Kubernetes or Terraform, similar principles apply.
3. Authorization: _coming soon_
4. Metrics: _coming soon_
5. Webapp: _coming soon_
