## Overview

As described in the [top-level README](../README.md), the mock scenario in these examples is a company that provides SaaS.

This example demonstrates multi-tenancy with multiple organizations and isolated users within each organization.
It sets up the following control plane in Nile:

- Sign up a new developer
- Create a workspace, which must be globally unique
- Create an entity type called that corresponds to whatever `NILE_ENTITY_NAME` is defined in your `.env` file (many are also available as a template from the Nile Admin Dashboard).  The available entity types are [here](../usecases/).
- Create two organizations with users
- Create 2 entity instance in one organization and 1 entity instance in other organization, with a value that matches the schema defined earlier

## Install Dependencies

Run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

Your output should resemble:

```bash
yarn install v1.22.19

```

## Execute

To execute the workflow, run the following command:

```
yarn start
```

## Validate

1. Login to the [Nile Admin Dashboard](https://nad.thenile.dev/) via SSO to see the control plane and entity instances (If your developer account is not SSO, enter the `NILE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL` and `NILE_DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` values you specified in the `.env` file).

2. Validate tenant isolation by running the command below. For example, if you used the `Database as a Service` use case, at first user polina@demo.io cannot see the organization `Indus Systems` nor any instances in it, but after adding polina@demo.io to `Indus Systems`, polina@demo.io can see all the instances in `Indus Systems` that frank@demo.io can see.

```
yarn test
```
