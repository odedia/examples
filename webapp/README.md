# Self-serve Webapp

![image](../images/Nile-text-logo.png)

## Overview

This example shows a SaaS service integrated with [Nile](https://thenile.dev/). 
Nile provides an entity system, event system, and tenant-aware metrics.

The mock scenario in these examples is a company that provides SaaS.

![image](../images/saas.png)

These examples let you choose what kind of SaaS offering is provided, one of:

- [Database as a Service](../usecases/DB/) (same as in the Nile Quickstart)
- [SkyNet as a Service](../usecases/SkyNet/)
- [Banking as a Service](../usecases/Banking/)
- [Workload as a Service](../usecases/Workload/)
- [YOLO](../usecases/README.md#yolo)

Everything you need to run this example is in one of the folders above.
Once a developer initializes their control plane in Nile with their service's entity schema, they can capture events as end users create new instances to reconcile Nile with their data plane, get built-in multi-tenancy and authorization policies, and show metrics to users for consumption and billing.
This webapp demonstrates a sample frontend for their SaaS application that integrates with the control plane using Nile React components for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
It provides self-service workflows for user signup/login, org creation, and instance management.

## Setup Certificates

1. At the current time, Nile will only serve cookies to `\*.thenile.dev` domains, which is required for login, so you must put this app in that domain. Create certificates for your local machine and accept them.

- Edit `/etc/hosts` and add `127.0.0.1 local.thenile.dev`.
- Run `mkdir .certificates && cd .certificates`
- Add an SSL key that lasts 1 year

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
     -days 365 \
     -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
     -subj '/CN=*.thenile.dev' -extensions EXT -config <( \
     printf "[dn]\nCN=*.thenile.dev\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:*.thenile.dev\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
   ```

2. Open the certificate just created (`open localhost.crt`), and double click on the certificate in your keychain. Be sure it is added to the `login` keychain.

3. From the pop up window, open the dropdown for `Trust` and select `Always Trust`.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Initialize Nile

To run these examples, you need to access to Nile. Please [reach out](https://www.thenile.dev) for more information.

1. For all examples, you need a local file with your Nile configuration.
For that purpose, at the top-level of the examples, copy the `.env.defaults` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   # From the top level of the examples folder
   $ examples> cp .env.defaults .env
   ```

   Set the values in this `.env` file to match the values you want in your control plane.
   Be sure to set the following parameters

   - `NILE_URL`
   - `NILE_WORKSPACE`
   - `NILE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL`
   - `NILE_DEVELOPER_PASSWORD`
   - `NILE_ENTITY_NAME`: refers to one of your selected [usecases](../usecases/), default value is `DB`.

3. Run the following command to preconfigure the Nile control plane with the mock usecase so that you're not starting from scratch.

   ```bash
   yarn setup-nile
   ```

4. (Optional) If you want to hook up your Nile control plane to a data plane and provision real resources, run the reconciler to synchronize events between the control plane and data plane (e.g. if you use the webapp to create new entity instances). Follow the instructions in the [Pulumi example](../data-plane/pulumi/) and start the reconciler in a separate terminal window.

## Run the web server locally

Run the web server locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Playbook

1. As an end user: open [https://local.thenile.dev](http://local.thenile.dev) with your browser and log in as one of the predefined users for the entity type from the [usecases](../usecases/). For example, for entity type `DB`, you can log in as `polina@demo.io` (password is `password`).

   The user login screen should resemble below:

   ![image](images/login.png)

2. Once logged in, the user sees the entity instances (e.g. databases in this mock scenario) that she has access to.

3. Click on one of the instances to see metrics. These metrics are currently mock generated from the webapp itself, so it will take some time for them to initialize and start to render.

4. Logout. Then instead of logging in as an existing user, sign up as a new user.  Enter any email/password, then create an organization name.

5. Create a new instance.  If you are running the reconciler in a separate terminal window (see [initialize Nile](#initialize-nile)), then observe the resources being provisioned and updating Nile with its status.

6. As a Nile developer: log into the [Nile Admin Dashboard](https://nad.thenile.dev/) to see the control plane and entity instances.
Notice the multi-tenancy features, with tenants belonging to different organizations.
For the email and password, use the `NILE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL` and `NILE_DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` values you specified in the `.env` file.

   Your dashboard should resemble below:
