# Authorization on the Backend

![image](../images/Nile-text-logo.png)

## Overview

As described in the [top-level README](../README.md), the mock scenario in these examples is a company that provides SaaS.

![image](../images/saas.png)

The default scenario in these examples is a company that provides a database as SaaS.
But you can modify the `NILE_ENTITY_NAME` parameter in your `.env` file to change it to be any other type of service offering (see [Advanced](../README.md#advanced)).

For this service, you can use Nile's built-in entities to enforce access policies.
This example demonstrates how to use your existing backend applications and add a middleware to use authorization from Nile.
It starts with an application that does just basic user authentication and then layers in [authorization](middleware/authz-nile.ts) by calling out to Nile to validate the logged in user is allowed to access the resources.

Credit: the base example of the webapp is heavily borrowed from this [authentication guide](https://github.com/LoginRadius/engineering-blog-samples/tree/master/NodeJs/NodejsAuthenticationGuide).

## Install Dependencies

1. Run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

Your output should resemble:

```bash
yarn install v1.22.19
warning package.json: No license field
warning No license field
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
‚ú®  Done in 2.26s.
```

2. For the web application and database:

- Install and run MongoDB

  - [Install mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
  - run MongoDB in the background: `mongod --config /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf &`
  - [Install mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/), a MongoDB CLI for logging in and cleanup

## Setup

You must do all the steps in the [Setup section](../README.md#setup) of the top-level README.md.

:stop_sign: **STOP** :stop_sign: Do not proceed until you have done the above setup :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Then, run the following command to preconfigure the Nile control plane with an entity, organizations, users, and entity instances for the mock usecase, so that you're not starting from scratch.

```bash
yarn setup-nile
```

## Execute

1. First run the [application](server-without-authz.js) without Nile authorization:

```
yarn start-without-authz
```

Use any browser to go to `http://locahost:5000`. Login with any of the listed users and then click `Test authz` to the variety of pages.
Notice that all the users have access to all the pages: `page1`, `page2`, `page3`.

2. Now run the [application](server.js) with Nile authorization.

```
yarn start
```

This time, in addition to running the application, it also sets up the [Nile control plane](src/index.ts), defines entities and entity instances that correspond to the application pages, adds users to different organizations, and configures authorization policies as defined below.

3. View the code changes required for this example application:

```
diff server.js server-without-authz.js
```

4. View the example [Nile authorization code](middleware/authz-nile.ts).


## Validate

1. Login to the [Nile Admin Dashboard](https://nad.thenile.dev/) via SSO to see the control plane and entity instances (If your developer account is not SSO, enter the `NILE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL` and `NILE_DEVELOPER_PASSWORD` values you specified in the `.env` file).

2. Cross-check which users are authorized to see which pages.  For example, if you used the `Database as a Service` use case, `parker@demo.io` is in org `Danube Tech` which has entities for `myDB-products`(=page1) and `myDB-billing`(=page2).  Therefore when `parker@demo.io` tries to view either of those entities, he will be able to see those pages:

But if `shaun@demo.io` tries to view `myDB-analytics`(=page2) which belongs to a different org `Indus Systems`, he will not be able to see the page:

## MongoDB cheatsheet

Run `mongosh` to connect to your local database, here are some useful commands:

```
use role_auth;
db.users.find();
db.pages.find();
```

To cleanup and shutdown your local MongoDB collections:

```
db.users.drop();
db.pages.drop();
db.shutdownServer()
```

This script will drop those tables and drop ALL policies for those organizations:

```
yarn clean
```
