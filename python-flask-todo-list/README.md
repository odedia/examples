# Example SaaS application built with Python's Flask framework.

## Status
The application is kinda basic. You can view, add, update and delete tasks in a list.

It has some nifty SaaS features, implemented with Nile:
* Users can sign up and then log in to our application
* Only logged in users can create, update or delete tasks
* Tasks can be public, and then anyone can view them or private and visible only to their creator
* Only the creator of a task can update or delete a task

Some SaaS features you'd expect are still missing:

* Invite others to collaborate on the same task list
* Growth metrics and badges to the top users
* Helpful onboarding nudges
* RBAC or ABAC
... and a lot more (open issues and let us know what else you'd want us to support)

But don't worry, this is why Nile Platform exists - to make it easy to add all these features. 

In follow up commits, we'll add all these capabilities step by step using Nile.
So you can learn to SaaSify your own application with Nile.

## To run this application on your own laptop:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheNileDev/examples
cd examples/python-flask-todo-list

# Install Flask and few other dependencies (they are captured in requirements.txt). venv is recommended but not mandatory
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate 
pip install Flask
pip install PyJWT
pip install urllib3
pip install python-dotenv
pip install nile-api

export FLASK_ENV=development

flask init-db # only needed the first time

# Replace localhost with URL that you got from the Nile team
echo NILE=\'http://localhost:8080\' >> instance/config.py

flask run
```

Thats it! You should see something like:

```
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 599-119-277
```

and if you head over to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ you will see the world's most basic todo webapp. 

## Development via Docker
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Copy `.env.template` and specify a value for `NILE_URL`.
3. Run `docker-compose up`. You should see the same message as above and access the app using the same url and port.

## To run in production
Don't. 

This is a toy app meant to demonstrate Nile's APIs. 

Ping us (gwen@thenile.dev) if you want to use Nile's APIs in production, but definitely not this toy Flask thing.
